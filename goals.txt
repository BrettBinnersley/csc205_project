Gameplay:
 - Multiple scenes (ie: Menu, Room1, Room2, Room3....)
 - A smart AI that tries to defeat the player and other AI's.
    - IE: Multiple NPC players that interact with each other AND everything in the scene.
 - Well defined goal (story?)

Graphics:
 - Transparency in images
 - Color filters (Draw same image with different colors overlayed: IE: green enhanced)
   - In 3D this can be done on a vertex shader. I have no idea how this is done with Graphics2D, but I would like to look into it.
 - Advanced transformations (ie: image Skewing, Scaling, & multiple transformations applied)
 - Improved Particle Systems

Interaction:
 - Bots interact with the player (AI).
 - Limit number of bullets (Can pick up ammo?).
 - Everything in the scene can be interacted with, with the exception of particles.

Optimization:
 - With scrolling view (above), not every object can run collisions against every other object (N^2, expensive with many objects). I hope to implement an NlogN solution, or an even quicker one using hashing.
 - For the AI to interact with every object, optimizations need to be done (once again, probably using hashing to determine all the objects it can possibly interact with).
 - Improve current game engine

Sound:
 - I know this isn't the goal of the course, but I would like to add sound to the game.
